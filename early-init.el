;; This file is not part of GNU Emacs.

;;; Commentary:

;; Starting with version 27, Emacs is configured using an early init file.  It
;; is loaded before graphical elements such as the toolbar are initialized,
;; and before the package manager is initialized.  Earlier versions will not
;; load this file and do not implicitely call `package-initialize' before
;; loading the init file.
;;
;; NOTE: We are not currently testing Xorns for Emacs < 27, so some
;; optimization processes may not work properly.
